==================================================
TIEBREAKERS BETWEEN TWO TEAMS
-----------------------------
1. Head-to-head record.
2. Intradivision record.
3. Intraleague record.
4. Record in the last half of intraleague games (after All-Star break).
5. Record in the last half plus one intraleague game, going back until tie is resolved.

TIEBREAKERS BETWEEN THREE TEAMS
-------------------------------
If all 3 teams have identical records against each other:
  a. Highest intradivision winning percentage.
  b. Highest intraleague winning percentage.
  c. Highest winning percentage in the last half of intraleague games.
  d. Highest winning percentage in the last half plus one intraleague game, continuing back if tied.

If the 3 teams do NOT have identical head-to-head records:
  a. A team with a better record against both other teams qualifies.
  b. If no team has that, rank by combined record among the three:
     - Highest overall winning percentage qualifies.
     - If two are tied, use two-team tiebreakers.
     - If all are tied, use the identical-record three-team rules.

Note: If three teams tie for a division and one Wild Card, the division champ is decided first,
then the remaining two use the two-team tiebreaker.

TIEBREAKERS BETWEEN FOUR TEAMS
------------------------------
1. Best record against each of the other three clubs.
2. Highest winning percentage in games among the four tied clubs.
3. Highest intradivision winning percentage.
4. Highest intraleague winning percentage.
5. Highest winning percentage in last half of intraleague games.
6. Highest winning percentage in last half plus one intraleague game, going back until resolved.

* If two teams remain tied, apply the two-team rules.
* If three remain tied, apply the three-team rules.
